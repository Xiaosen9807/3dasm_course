# Data-Driven Design &amp; Analysis of Structures &amp; Materials (3dasm)

Miguel A. Bessa | M.A.Bessa@tudelft.nl | Associate Professor

## Introduction

**What:** This course aims to be an introduction to machine learning from a probabilistic perspective.

**Where:** This notebook comes from this [repository](https://github.com/bessagroup/3dasm_course)

**Reference:** Murphy, Kevin P. *Probabilistic machine learning: an introduction*. MIT press, 2022. Available online [here](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book1.html)

**How:** We try to follow Murphy's book closely, but the sequence of Chapters and Sections is different. The intention is to use notebooks as an introduction to the topic and Murphy's book as a resource.
* If working offline: Go through this notebook and read the book.
* If attending class in person: listen to me (!) but also go through the notebook in your laptop at the same time. Read the book.
* If attending lectures remotely: listen to me (!) via Zoom and (ideally) use two screens where you have the notebook open in 1 screen and you see the lectures on the other. Read the book.

**Folder structure**
* The "Lectures" folder contains each lecture in a separate folder "Lecture_X"
* Each "Lecture_X" folder contains:
    1. A jupyter notebook "3dasm_Lecture_X.ipynb" that you can run locally or in servers like Google Colab.
    2. An html file "3dasm_Lecture_X.slides.html" that contains the slides for the course (compiled from the notebook).
    3. A pdf "3dasm_Lecture_X slides.pdf" with the slides of the course (printed from the html file).
    4. A "docs" folder with all the files needed for each lecture.
* The preferred method to follow the course is to look directly into the jupyter notebook, as it contains additional notes and working code.

** This course is under construction. Comments are welcome.
